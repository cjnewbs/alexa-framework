# Alexa Skill Framework

I built this to make it simple to create Amazon Alexa skills using PHP. It handles the request verification, intent routing, provides some methods to get intent/slot information from the request and methods for building the response object to AVS.

#### To install:
- Run `composer require newbury/alexa-framework`,
- Copy the contents of the contents of the `/example` directory to the application root,
- Set the webserver document root to `/pub`,
